<h1> The Best Movies According to Madeleine</h1>

<h2>Movies I love to watch</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Top Gun Maverick</h3>
<p>I love both of the Top Gun movies, but this movie had me on the edge of my seat. It really had my blod pumping.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Can´t go wrong with a Harry Potter movie night. I´ll watch any of them.</p>

<h3>Marvel Movies</h3>
<p>This is a whole bunch of movies, but I haven´t yet seen one I dont like. Even hearing the intro music brings a smile to my face :) </p>
