<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Madeleine, I am a 32 years old woman, who studies web development. I also work as a hairdresser in  a very popular hairsalon in Sarpsborg, Norway.
  It has been very educating working with such talented people the last 4 years. Every day has a new challange, which is fun, but now I'm really curious about what
  web development can offer. How this can expand my field as a human beeing trying to find out what my passion in life is.
</p>

<p>Sarpsborg is the town I grew up in, and I still live here. Most of my family lives here too, thats why my boyfriend and I decited to build our first home together here.
  I met my boyfriend 14 years ago, but we only got together 4 years ago. He´s my best friend and one day I really hope that I can call him my husband.
</p>

<p>The light of my life is our little daughter, Mina. She is such a ray of sunlight. I can´t wait seeing what kind of person she grows up to become.
  My gut tells me she´s going to be awesome. </p>
